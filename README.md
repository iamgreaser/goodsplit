Goodsplit is an autosplitter-first split timer for speedrunning.

Yep, that's right. Manually splitting is a second-class thing.

Because of that, you don't need to come up with your own splits or work out what you're going to do first. It'll add splits as you go along, and if you get two things mixed up it'll adapt on the fly.
